An example project that contains dummy blueprints and spawners for them. As time goes on this project will be updated with more blueprints. 

# Available Spawners

Currently swimming and climbing volumes have spawners, anything else requires manual spawners. [You can learn how to create that from here](https://franklygd.github.io/Spyro-Reignited-Trilogy-Asset-Replacement/Level-Making/3-Spawning-Actors-In-Custom-Levels/)

# Example Maps

There are two maps that show how swimming, climbing, collision surfaces work. [More information about the collision surfaces can be found in here.](https://franklygd.github.io/Spyro-Reignited-Trilogy-Asset-Replacement/Level-Making/Blueprint-Info/) 
Most of the gameplay effects used by Reignited Trilogy is also included in the project you can also [check blueprint information page to see their functions and how to use them.](https://franklygd.github.io/Spyro-Reignited-Trilogy-Asset-Replacement/Level-Making/Blueprint-Info/)
